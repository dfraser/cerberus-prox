----

*allowed* is true iff access was granted and the door was opened.

*magic* is true if the card used has the magic flag set

*unknown* is true if the card wasn't found in the database.  This probably means that 'allowed' and 'magic' will also be false, and it definitely means that the *nickName* and *firstName* fields will be undefined.
